                    Eriaverse is not only a well-developed fantasy world. Eriaverse is thousands of players, investors, and enthusiasts, who firmly believe in the true digital assets’ ownership in a new era of entertainment industry development and are united in a large international community.

                    Eriaverse’s mission is to acknowledge and reward players’ skills, efforts, and loyalty, as well as to acquaint  the majority with the blockchain’s value. Besides that, we put it first to build a convenient games’ ecosystem, in which items, characters, real estate, collectible cards, and pets are bonded to eachother in a single ecosystem — Eriaverse.

            The world of Eria is filled with hundreds of different creatures — from proud intimidating dragons, wyverns, manticores, gryphons, and thestrals to incredibly cute and attractive pegasi, unicorns, lizards, sphinxes and everyone’s favorite cats and dogs. Moreover, every single one of them does not only have its unique characters and preferences, but also possess its own distinctive aspect — magic, elements and combinations of these elements. In many ways, it is the aspect that determines the pet’s cost.
            <br><br>
            Born from a mystical egg, small pet has to go through all stages of growing up, and you – to escort your friend along this way: monitor the health, hygiene, hunger and happiness of your pet. Its element and species will tell you your pet’s needs. For example, electric wyverns need to release energy regularly in mini-games to avoid stress, and ground turtles prefer to eat plenty of food more often than others do.
            <br><br>
            In return for care and treats, your little digital friend will reward you daily. In addition, the scale of happiness is one of the determining factors for making the greatest profit. to increase this indicator, you need to play mini-games with your pet, feed it regularly, do not forget about its hygiene and health, and motivate its activity while being outdoors.
            <br><br>

            Every pet goes through three stages of growing up, every single one of which reveals new mini-games and P2E mechanics. Free and various mini-games will suit people of all, will make Eria Everbright’s gameplay more interesting, and will please your pet, increasing its happiness.

                    Are purple moths, the size of an average dog. You can meet dozens of them in every elvish town. These moths usually live near people, uniting in flocks and robbing elven gardens, for what they got their name. Moths are herbivores creatures, not very fussy about food. Their favorite treat is yellow cabbage, popular across many elvish lands.

                <p>
                    There has never been a single case when a moth itself would attack a human, an elf or even an orc. The appearance of moths fully reflects their character — soat and fluffy, moths lvery like to be petted, spent time with, and when their needs are fulfilled.
